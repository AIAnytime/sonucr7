# Hi GitHub, I am Sonu üôè
# AI Engineer | Researcher | Tech Content Creator

I am an AI Engineer @Capgemini, content creator, and technopreneur, currently working on multiple fronts where Deep Learning and Computer Vision are mysterious, including understanding business needs, rethinking AI capacity, and research that opens the door for an even better society. I believe in the power of technology to transform and improve the lives of people around the world. 

I love to dig into challenging problems and solve them with modern technology. As an entrepreneur, I excel at the execution of big ideas with given constraints. 

Prior to Capgemini, I have worked with a couple of startups full-time and helped few early-stage startups to build POC (Sports Analytics, Safety, and Surveillance solution, Agriculture platform, etc) as a community member.

Reach out if you want to talk to me about **emerging tech, solving real-world problems, or football.**

**There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build.**

**Skills/Specialties:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Streamlit, AI Blueprint, AIOps, AI Research, AWS ML Stack, Docker, Product Development, Public Speaking.

**I code in Python üêç with working knowledge of Go, and JavaScript.**
