# Hi GitHub, I am Sonu Kumar üôè
# AI Evangelist | Researcher | Tech Content Creator

I am an AI practitioner, content creator, and technopreneur, currently working on multiple fronts where Deep Learning and Computer Vision are mysterious, including understanding business needs, rethinking AI capacity, and research that opens the door for an even better society. I believe in the power of technology to transform and improve the lives of people around the world. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build.

I love to dig into challenging problems and solve them with modern technology. As an entrepreneur, I excel at the execution of big ideas with given constraints. Currently, I am an AI Practitioner and also a member of the founding body at McMarvin that is a Deep Tech Startup based out of Bengaluru, India. We have been implementing a couple of products that include Deep Learning, Cloud stack, and Bioinformatics.
